# sync.Pool from the pool

It's summer and I love hanging out by the pool ...
so it's just logic that I would make an episode about sync.Pool!

In this episode we learn how to measure how many memory allocations
a program is performing and how to reduce them thanks to sync.Pool,
as well as how to identify which piece of your code is
allocating the memory thanks to pprof.
