# The Basics of Protocol Buffers

Many people have asked me about videos on gRPC, and I decided that before
getting into those technical topics it'd be nice to have an intro video
to Protocol Buffers (aka protobufs), which are one of the basic technologies
at Google, and which is part of most of Google APIs and services.

I hope you enjoy this episode!
