Visualizing data is almost a prerequisite to understand it, and while Python has the amazing numpy and pyplot libraries not many know about the Go alternatives.

In this episode I'll show you how to use gonum.org in order to plot the distribution of the latencies for an HTTP endpoint using only Go's gonum.
